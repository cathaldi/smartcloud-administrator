F.A.Q.
======

What IBM Smart Cloud BSS?
-------------------------
The BSS handles authentication, authorization and provisioning for `IBM SmartCloud <hhttps://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpAPIViewer.xsp?lookupName=API+Reference>`_ components
This library is intended for use to aid in the above tasks and not for directly interacting with Connections, Sametime or Notes.

What is needed to use this code?
--------------------------------
An active IBM SmartCloud subscription and an account.
To really make the most of this code at least CustomerAdministrator privilege is required in order to manage your Organization.

Will this work on an account created through a third party/IBM Martketplace
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It should work the same for a reseller organization but for an organization created through IBM Marketplace it should be fine
to read data but and updates should be done through a separate API which is currently not handled by this code.

**Note:**

Accounts created through traditional IBM processes will work.
